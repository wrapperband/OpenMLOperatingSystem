This file contains the implementation of the bios machine learning system.

The bios system is responsible for booting up the operating system and initializing the hardware. It uses the BrainNet neural net framework to perform these tasks.

The main function of the bios system is to pull the seed code from the ROM, read the last settings from the battery memory, and start the setting control net. The setting control net uses machine learning algorithms to make intelligent decisions about the system settings, based on the last settings and user input.

The ROM contains a tiny neural net and its associated weights. This neural net has been trained to call the neural net stored in the battery memory, which contains the system settings. If the neural net in the battery memory is not found, the ROM neural net will write the system setting neural net framework to the battery memory.
