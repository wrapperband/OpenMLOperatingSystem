# Community guidelines

As a community-driven project, M-Lop relies on the contributions and participation of its members to continue growing and improving. In order to maintain a collaborative and inclusive environment, we have established the following guidelines for the M-Lop community:

- **Be respectful and considerate**: Treat other members of the community with respect and kindness, and avoid making personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination of any kind.

- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on M-Lop and related topics, and avoid introducing unrelated or off-topic discussions.

- **Encourage and support others**: Help other members of the community by providing feedback, suggestions, and assistance, and encourage them to continue contributing to the project.

- **Follow the rules**: Adhere to the community guidelines and any other rules or policies that have been established for the M-Lop project.

## Forking the project

If you are interested in contributing to the development of M-Lop, one way to get started is by forking the project on GitHub. This allows you to make your own copy of the M-Lop codebase, which you can then modify and test without affecting the main development branch.

To fork the M-Lop project on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [M-Lop repository](https://github.com/wrapperband/OpenMLOperatingSystem) on GitHub.

2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.

3. Choose the account where you want to fork the project (if you have multiple accounts on GitHub).

4. Wait for the fork to be created (this may take a few minutes).

Once the fork has been created, you will have your own copy of the M-Lop codebase, which you can modify and test as you please. You can also submit changes and improvements to the main M-Lop development branch by creating a pull request.

## Pushing changes as issues

Another way to contribute to the M-Lop project is by pushing changes as issues on GitHub. This allows you to suggest and discuss changes to the M-Lop codebase, without having to make direct modifications to the code.

To push changes as an issue on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [M-Lop repository](https://github.com/wrapperband/OpenMLOperatingSystem) on GitHub.

2. Click the "Issues" tab in the top menu.

3. Click the "New issue" button in the top-right corner of the page.

4. Enter a descriptive title and detailed description for the issue, including any relevant information or examples.

5. Use the "Labels" and "Milestones" fields to categorize and organize the issue.

6. Click the "Submit new issue" button to create the issue.

Once the issue has been created, other members of the M-Lop community will be able to view and discuss the suggested changes. If the changes are deemed to be valuable and feasible, they may be implemented in a future release of M-Lop.
