### What are low level Machine Learning controlled computer operating systems?

Low-level machine learning controlled computer operating systems, or M-Lop for short, are a new class of operating systems that leverage the power of machine learning to enable a wide range of advanced functionality. In this white paper, we will discuss the key components of M-Lop systems and how they work together to provide an intuitive and efficient user experience.

### Components of an M-Lop System

An M-Lop system consists of several key components, including:

- **Training systems**: These systems are responsible for training the machine learning algorithms that are at the heart of M-Lop systems. This training can be done either on-device, using local data, or in the cloud, using large amounts of data from multiple devices.

- **Hardware access**: M-Lop systems are designed to be able to access and control a wide range of hardware, from sensors and actuators to display screens and input devices. This allows the system to provide a rich and responsive user experience, as well as enable new applications and services that were not possible with traditional operating systems.

- **Automatic driver creation**: One of the key challenges of using machine learning to control hardware is the need to create drivers that enable the system to communicate with the hardware. M-Lop systems address this challenge by using machine learning algorithms to automatically generate the necessary drivers, without the need for manual coding.

- **Expert assistance request**: M-Lop systems are designed to be able to request assistance from human experts when necessary. For example, if the system encounters a hardware device or situation that it does not know how to handle, it can request assistance from a human expert who can provide guidance on how to proceed.

- **Training updates**: M-Lop systems are designed to be able to continuously learn and improve over time. This means that they can be updated with new training data and algorithms, either automatically or with the assistance of human experts, to ensure that they remain effective and efficient.

- **Brain controller**: The core of an M-Lop system is the "brain controller," which is a machine learning algorithm that is responsible for controlling the system and making decisions on behalf of the user. This algorithm is trained using a wide range of data, including user behavior, hardware data, and external information, to enable it to make intelligent and informed decisions.

- **Bios brain**: The bios brain is a special component of an M-Lop system that is responsible for booting up the system and initializing the hardware. This component is typically implemented using machine learning algorithms that are trained to identify the hardware components of the system and configure them appropriately.

- **Local learning**: M-Lop systems are designed to be able to learn from the data generated by the user and the hardware on the device. This local learning allows the system to adapt and improve over time, without the need for external data or assistance.

### Conclusion

M-Lop systems are a new and exciting development in the world of computer operating systems. By leveraging the power of machine learning, these systems are able to provide a rich and intuitive user experience, as well as enable new applications and services that were not possible with traditional operating systems. We believe that M-Lop systems represent the future of computing and we are excited to see what the future
